# Here is a complete list of configuration parameters:
#
# ANDROID_SDK    The path where the Android SDK is placed on your system.
#
# TARGET         The Android target. For a complete list, type Makefile targets.
#
# DEVICE         The device where you want to run your app on. Set to ALL for uploading
#                your app on all devices attached.
#
# ACTIVITY       The main activity you want to run.
#
# This makefile also defines the following goals for use on the command line
# when you run make:
#
# all            This is the default goal if no one is specified. It builds the apk.
#
# clean          Deletes files created during the build.
#
# upload         Uploads the last debug apk on an attached Android DEVICE.
#                Set DEVICE to a specified target, or to ALL for every device attached.
#
# sign           (TODO)Generate a signed package.
#
# restartadb     Restarts adb. Sometimes needed.
#
# devices        Shows the list of all available DEVICEs.
#
# targets        Shows the list of all available targets.
#
# log            Shows the log of a specified DEVICE. Set DEVICE to a specified target.
